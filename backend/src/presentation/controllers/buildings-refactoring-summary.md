# Buildings Controller Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The buildings controller has been refactored to follow Clean Architecture principles while maintaining compatibility with the existing JavaScript environment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Use Cases (TypeScript)
- `GetBuildingByIdUseCase` - Retrieves a single building with optional events
- `UpdateBuildingUseCase` - Updates building data and tracks status changes
- `DeleteBuildingUseCase` - Soft deletes buildings by setting status to inactive

### 2. Updated Infrastructure
- Added `findByBuildingId` method to `IEventRepository` interface
- Implemented the method in `SequelizeEventRepository`
- Updated the container to include all building use cases

### 3. Created New Controller
- Location: `/src/presentation/controllers/buildings.controller.js`
- Implements temporary repository and use case classes for JavaScript compatibility
- Maintains the same API interface as the original controller
- Supports all existing features:
  - Pagination
  - Search functionality
  - Status filtering
  - Event tracking for building operations

### 4. Updated Routes
- Routes now use the new controller from the presentation layer
- No changes to API endpoints or validation

## Architecture Pattern

The refactored controller follows Clean Architecture with these layers:

1. **Domain Layer**: Entity definitions and repository interfaces (TypeScript)
2. **Application Layer**: Use cases that orchestrate business logic (TypeScript)
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Repository implementations and external services
4. **Presentation Layer**: Controllers that handle HTTP requests/responses

## Transitional Approach

Since the project uses both JavaScript and TypeScript without a build process, the controller includes temporary implementations of repositories and use cases directly in the file. This allows:

- Immediate functionality without TypeScript compilation
- Clean Architecture patterns in JavaScript
- Easy migration to full TypeScript when build process is added

## API Compatibility

All endpoints maintain the same interface:
- `GET /api/buildings` - List buildings with pagination and filters
- `GET /api/buildings/:id` - Get single building with events
- `POST /api/buildings` - Create new building
- `PUT /api/buildings/:id` - Update building
- `DELETE /api/buildings/:id` - Soft delete building

## Next Steps

1. Add TypeScript compilation to the build process
2. Remove temporary implementations from the controller
3. Use the TypeScript repositories and use cases directly
4. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
